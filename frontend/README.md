#  Hex frontend - web client
_This crate is part of the [Hex](http://github.com/bytesnake/hex) project and is served by the server._

The web client allows the user to manage all music. It provides a nice visual interface to change the database and manages tracks, playlists and tokens. For example it will:
 * show a summarize in the start page about available and most favourite tracks
 * let you create playlists and change their description
 * allow to search for tracks
 * connect token to playlist and shows the latest played token
 * upload and download tracks from the server
 * etc.
